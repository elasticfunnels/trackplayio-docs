This guide explains how TrackPlay's conversion tracking system works and how to optimize it for maximum accuracy.

## How Conversion Tracking Works

TrackPlay uses a sophisticated tracking system to connect video views with actual purchases:

### 1. Session Generation
- Each video viewer gets a unique session ID
- Session IDs are automatically generated when the video player loads
- Sessions persist across page navigation and browser sessions

### 2. Link Modification
TrackPlay automatically modifies purchase links on your page:
- **Clickbank links**: URLs containing "clickbank.net"
- **Buygoods links**: URLs containing "buygoods.com"
- **Form actions**: Purchase forms are also updated with tracking parameters

### 3. Parameter Injection
- The system injects the session ID into your chosen tracking parameter
- This happens automatically for links and forms
- Original parameter values are safely replaced with session tracking data

### 4. Conversion Capture
- When users complete purchases, payment processors send data to TrackPlay
- Conversion data is matched to the original video session
- Multiple conversion types are tracked (sales, refunds, chargebacks)

## Automatic Link Detection

TrackPlay scans your page for purchase links when:
- The page finishes loading (`load` event)
- Browser navigation occurs (`popstate` event)  
- 1 second after page load (fallback timer)

This ensures tracking works even with dynamically loaded content.

## Optimization Best Practices

### 1. Link Placement
- Place purchase links on the same page as your TrackPlay video
- Ensure links are visible when the video player loads
- Avoid loading purchase links after significant delays

### 2. URL Structure
- Use standard payment processor URLs
- Ensure URLs contain the expected domain patterns:
  - Clickbank: "clickbank.net"
  - Buygoods: "buygoods.com"
- Avoid URL redirects that might break tracking

### 3. Integration Configuration
- Choose tracking parameters that don't conflict with your existing campaigns
- Test with small transactions before full deployment
- Monitor integration status regularly

### 4. Page Performance
- Ensure TrackPlay videos load quickly
- Minimize JavaScript conflicts
- Test on mobile devices and different browsers

## Troubleshooting Conversion Tracking

### No Conversions Showing

**Check Integration Status**
- Verify integration shows "Ready to use"
- Ensure all required parameters are configured
- Confirm postback URLs are set in payment processor

**Verify Link Detection**
- Check that purchase links are present on the page
- Ensure links contain the correct domain patterns
- Test with browser developer tools to see if URLs are modified

**Test Purchase Flow**
- Make a test purchase to verify end-to-end tracking
- Check that tracking parameters appear in the checkout URL
- Verify payment processor receives tracking data

### Partial Conversion Data

**Missing Customer Information**
- Some payment processors limit customer data sharing
- Check privacy settings in your payment processor account
- Verify postback URL configuration includes all data fields

**Incomplete Technical Data**
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled for visitors
- Check for browser compatibility issues
- Verify TrackPlay video player loads completely

### Attribution Issues

**Wrong Video Attribution**
- Check that each video has a unique video code
- Verify videos are properly configured in TrackPlay
- Ensure session tracking isn't being shared across videos

**Cross-Domain Problems**
- Review your domain configuration
- Check for third-party cookies blocking
- Test checkout flow across all domains

## Testing Your Setup

### 1. Visual Verification
- Load your page with TrackPlay video
- Right-click purchase links and "Inspect Element"
- Verify URLs now contain TrackPlay session parameters

### 2. Network Monitoring
- Use browser developer tools
- Check Network tab for TrackPlay requests
- Verify tracking parameters are being sent

### 3. Test Transactions
- Process small test purchases
- Check TrackPlay analytics for conversion data
- Verify data accuracy in payment processor

### 4. Cross-Browser Testing
- Test on different browsers and devices
- Verify tracking works on mobile
- Check for JavaScript compatibility issues
