Connect your Buygoods account to TrackPlay to automatically track conversions from your video content.

## Overview

The Buygoods integration allows TrackPlay to:
- Automatically inject tracking parameters into Buygoods purchase links
- Capture conversion data when purchases are completed
- Provide detailed analytics on video-driven sales

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Activate the Integration

1. Go to **Integrations** in your TrackPlay dashboard
2. Click **Add new integration** 
3. Select **Buygoods** from the available options
4. Click **Activate**

### Step 2: Configure Tracking Parameters

Choose which parameter TrackPlay should use to track conversions:

**Available Parameters:**
- `subid_1` - Subid 1
- `subid_2` - Subid 2  
- `subid_3` - Subid 3
- `vid1` - Vendor ID 1
- `vid2` - Vendor ID 2
- `vid3` - Vendor ID 3

1. Select your preferred tracking parameter from the dropdown
2. Click **Update Integration**

### Step 3: Configure Buygoods Postback URLs

Once your integration is ready, you'll see a unique postback URL. This URL needs to be added to your Buygoods product settings.

1. Copy the provided postback URL from TrackPlay
2. Log into your [Buygoods Admin Panel](https://admin.buygoods.com/#products-settings)
3. Navigate to **Product Settings**
4. Add the TrackPlay URL to the following fields:
   - **New Order URL**
   - **Order Refund URL** 
   - **Order Chargeback URL**

## How It Works

1. **Visitor watches your video** - TrackPlay generates a unique session ID
2. **Automatic link modification** - All Buygoods links on your page are automatically updated with the tracking parameter
3. **User makes purchase** - The tracking parameter connects the sale to the video session
4. **Conversion tracking** - Buygoods sends conversion data to TrackPlay via the postback URL
5. **Analytics** - View conversion metrics in your TrackPlay dashboard

## Tracking Parameters Explained

TrackPlay will automatically override your chosen parameter on all Buygoods URLs with the visitor's unique session ID. For example:

- Original URL: `https://buygoods.com/checkout?subid_1=abc123`
- Modified URL: `https://buygoods.com/checkout?subid_1=trackplay_session_xyz789`

## Security Note

⚠️ **Important**: Do not share your postback URL with anyone except the Buygoods team. This URL contains sensitive integration data.

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Status: "Not Ready"
- Ensure you've selected a tracking parameter
- Click "Update Integration" to save your settings

### No Conversions Showing
- Verify the postback URL is correctly set in Buygoods
- Check that your Buygoods links are present on the page with your TrackPlay video
- Ensure the integration status shows "Ready to use"

### Links Not Being Modified
- Confirm your Buygoods links contain "buygoods.com" in the URL
- Check that the TrackPlay video player has fully loaded
- Verify the integration is active and properly configured
