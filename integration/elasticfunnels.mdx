ElasticFunnels.io integration enhances your existing payment processor integrations by optimizing purchase links for better conversion tracking.

## Overview

The ElasticFunnels integration is different from other TrackPlay integrations. Instead of being a standalone payment processor, it acts as an enhancement layer that works with your existing integrations (Buygoods, Clickbank, Digistore24).

## What ElasticFunnels Does

When activated, ElasticFunnels will:
- Update purchase links for any other integrated vendors
- Optimize conversion tracking across multiple platforms
- Enhance the tracking capabilities of your existing integrations

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Activate the Integration

1. Go to **Integrations** in your TrackPlay dashboard
2. Click **Add new integration**
3. Select **ElasticFunnels.io** from the available options
4. Click **Activate**

### Step 2: Automatic Configuration

Unlike other integrations, ElasticFunnels requires minimal configuration:
- **Status**: Automatically set to "Ready to use" upon activation
- **No additional parameters required**
- **Works automatically with existing integrations**

## How It Works

1. **Prerequisites**: You must have at least one other integration active (Buygoods, Clickbank, or Digistore24)
2. **Link Enhancement**: ElasticFunnels scans for purchase links matching pattern `/b?p=`
3. **Parameter Injection**: Adds tracking parameters from your other active integrations
4. **Cross-Platform Tracking**: Enables unified tracking across multiple payment processors

## Technical Details

ElasticFunnels specifically looks for and modifies:
- URLs containing the pattern `/b?p=`
- Links are enhanced with parameters from your other active integrations
- Session tracking data is synchronized across platforms

## Integration Requirements

To use ElasticFunnels effectively:

1. **Active Payment Processor**: You need at least one of the following integrations configured:
   - Buygoods
   - Clickbank
   - Digistore24

2. **Proper Link Structure**: Your purchase links should follow ElasticFunnels URL patterns

3. **TrackPlay Video**: The enhancement only works on pages with active TrackPlay videos

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Tracking**: Better conversion attribution across multiple platforms
- **Simplified Setup**: Minimal configuration required
- **Cross-Platform Analytics**: Unified view of conversions from different sources
- **Automatic Optimization**: Works behind the scenes without manual intervention

## Compatibility

ElasticFunnels works with:
- ✅ Buygoods integration
- ✅ Clickbank integration  
- ✅ Digistore24 integration
- ✅ Multiple simultaneous integrations

## Status Information

- **Ready to use**: ElasticFunnels is active and enhancing your other integrations
- **No configuration UI**: Unlike other integrations, ElasticFunnels doesn't require parameter setup

## Troubleshooting

### ElasticFunnels Not Working
- Ensure you have at least one other payment integration active
- Check that your purchase links follow the expected URL patterns
- Verify that TrackPlay videos are properly loaded on your pages

### No Enhanced Tracking
- Confirm other integrations are properly configured
- Check that purchase links contain the `/b?p=` pattern
- Ensure the ElasticFunnels integration shows "Ready to use" status

## Best Practices

1. **Configure Base Integrations First**: Set up Buygoods, Clickbank, or Digistore24 before activating ElasticFunnels
2. **Test Integration**: Verify that enhanced tracking is working with test purchases
3. **Monitor Analytics**: Check that conversion data is being captured across all platforms
4. **Keep Other Integrations Active**: ElasticFunnels requires other integrations to function
