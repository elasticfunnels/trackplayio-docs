## Advanced Configuration Options

### Multi-Integration Setup
You can run multiple integrations simultaneously:
- Configure different payment processors for different products
- Use ElasticFunnels to enhance existing integrations
- Track conversions across multiple platforms

### Parameter Strategy
Choose parameters that don't conflict with existing campaigns:

**Dedicated Parameters**
- Reserve specific parameters only for TrackPlay
- Avoid parameters used by other tracking systems
- Document your parameter usage for team reference

**Conflict Resolution**
- If parameters are already in use, TrackPlay will override them
- Original parameter values will be replaced with session IDs
- Plan your parameter strategy to avoid data loss

### Integration Priority
When multiple integrations are active:
- Each integration operates independently
- ElasticFunnels enhances all other active integrations
- No conflicts between different payment processors

## Security Configuration

### Postback URL Security
- URLs contain unique codes for authentication
- Never share postback URLs publicly
- Only provide URLs to authorized payment processor personnel

### Encryption (Clickbank)
- Use strong encryption keys (recommended: 32+ characters)
- Store encryption keys securely
- Rotate keys periodically for enhanced security
- Ensure keys match between TrackPlay and Clickbank

### Access Control
- Limit integration configuration access to authorized team members
- Monitor integration status changes
- Review configuration changes regularly

## Testing Your Configuration

### Pre-Launch Testing

**1. Integration Status Check**
- Verify integration shows "Ready to use"
- Confirm all required parameters are configured
- Check that postback URLs are properly set

**2. Link Modification Test**
- Load a page with your TrackPlay video
- Inspect purchase links in browser developer tools
- Verify URLs now contain TrackPlay session parameters

**3. End-to-End Test**
- Process a small test purchase
- Check TrackPlay analytics for conversion data
- Verify data appears in your payment processor account

### Ongoing Monitoring

**Integration Health**
- Monitor integration status daily
- Set up alerts for status changes
- Regular configuration audits

**Performance Tracking**
