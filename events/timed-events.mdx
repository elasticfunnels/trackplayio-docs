Custom events that fire at specific times during video playback. **All event names are completely custom and defined by you** in your TrackPlay dashboard.

## How Timed Events Work

Timed events are completely custom events that you configure in your TrackPlay dashboard. You define:
- **Event name** (any name you choose - e.g., "cta", "offer", "milestone")
- **Trigger time** (specific time or percentage)
- **Call frequency** (once per session or multiple times)
- **Returning user behavior** (different events for subsequent visits)

<Warning>
**Important**: You must use the exact event name you configured in your dashboard settings. The examples below are just illustrations - replace them with your actual event names.
</Warning>

## Event Structure

All timed events follow this data structure:

```javascript
{
  time: 45.2,           // Time when event was triggered (seconds)
  percentage: 25.1,     // Percentage of video completed  
  session_id: "abc123"  // Device/session identifier
}
```

## Example Custom Events

Here are example event names you might configure (remember, you choose the names):

### Call-to-Action Example

**Event:** `cta` (you define this name in dashboard settings)

**Data:**
```javascript
{
  time: 30.0,           // Time when event was triggered (seconds)
  percentage: 16.7,     // Percentage of video completed  
  session_id: "abc123"  // Device/session identifier
}
```

```javascript
player.on('cta', function (event) {
  console.log('CTA event fired at', event.detail.time);
  console.log('Video completion:', event.detail.percentage + '%');
  showCallToAction();
});
```

### Offer Example

**Event:** `offer` (you define this name in dashboard settings)

**Data:**
```javascript
{
  time: 90.0,           // Time when event was triggered (seconds)
  percentage: 50.0,     // Percentage of video completed  
  session_id: "abc123"  // Device/session identifier
}
```

```javascript
player.on('offer', function (event) {
  console.log('Offer event fired at', event.detail.time);
  showSpecialOffer();
});
```

### Milestone Example

**Event:** `milestone` (you define this name in dashboard settings)

**Data:**
```javascript
{
  time: 60.0,           // Time when event was triggered (seconds)
  percentage: 33.3,     // Percentage of video completed  
  session_id: "abc123"  // Device/session identifier
}
```

```javascript
player.on('milestone', function (event) {
  console.log('Milestone reached at', event.detail.time);
  trackEngagement('milestone_reached');
});
```

## Subsequent Visit Events

If you enable the subsequent visit toggle, you'll get an extra event like `cta_subsequent` which will fire on every subsequent visit (for returning visitors).
This is useful to automatically show CTA containers for returning 

**Event:** `cta` (first-time visitors)

**Data:**
```javascript
{
  time: 30.0,           // Time when event was triggered (seconds)
  percentage: 16.7,     // Percentage of video completed  
  session_id: "abc123"  // Device/session identifier
}
```

```javascript
player.on('cta', function (event) {
  console.log('First-time visitor CTA');
  showFirstTimeCTA();
});
```

**Event:** `cta_subsequent` (returning visitors - automatically generated)

**Data:**
```javascript
{
  time: 30.0,           // Time when event was triggered (seconds)
  percentage: 16.7,     // Percentage of video completed  
  session_id: "abc123"  // Device/session identifier
}
```

```javascript
player.on('cta_subsequent', function (event) {
  console.log('Returning visitor CTA');
  showReturningVisitorCTA();
});
```

## Complete Integration Example

```javascript
document.addEventListener('TrackPlayReady', function (e) {
  let player = e.detail.player;
  
  // Listen to YOUR custom timed events (replace with your actual event names)
  player.on('cta', function (event) {
    console.log('CTA event fired at', event.detail.time);
    showCallToAction();
  });
  
  player.on('offer', function (event) {
    console.log('Offer event fired at', event.detail.percentage + '%');
    showSpecialOffer();
  });
  
  player.on('milestone', function (event) {
    console.log('Milestone reached');
    trackEngagement('milestone_reached');
  });
  
  // Handle returning user events if configured
  player.on('cta_subsequent', function (event) {
    console.log('Returning visitor CTA');
    showReturningVisitorCTA();
  });
});
```

## Event Configuration Options

When configuring timed events in your dashboard, you can set:

### Event Name
- **Choose any name**: "cta", "offer", "milestone", "chapter1", "signup", etc.
- **Use descriptive names**: Choose names that clearly indicate their purpose
- **Keep it simple**: Avoid spaces and special characters

### Trigger Timing
- **Specific time**: "Fire at 1:30 into the video"
- **Percentage**: "Fire at 25% completion"

### Call Frequency
- **Call once**: Event fires only once per session
- **Call multiple times**: Event fires every time the trigger point is reached

### Returning User Behavior
- **Same event**: Returning users get the same event
- **Different event**: Returning users get a `_subsequent` version of the event

## Data Structure

All timed events include these fields:

- **`time`**: Time when event was triggered (seconds)
- **`percentage`**: Percentage of video completed when triggered
- **`session_id`**: Unique device/session identifier

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive names**: Choose event names that clearly indicate their purpose
2. **Plan your timing**: Consider the user experience when setting trigger times
3. **Handle gracefully**: Always check if elements exist before manipulating them
4. **Test both scenarios**: Test both first-time and returning user flows
5. **Use event data**: Leverage the time and percentage data for better tracking
