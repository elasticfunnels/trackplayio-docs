title: "Domain Whitelist"
description: "Control which domains can embed and stream your TrackPlay videos"
---

TrackPlay's domain whitelist feature allows you to control which websites can embed and stream your videos. This provides security and prevents unauthorized use of your content on unwanted domains.

<Note>
Domain whitelisting is available for workspace owners and admins. When no domains are configured, videos can be embedded anywhere.
</Note>

## How It Works

### Default Behavior
- **No domains configured**: Videos can be embedded on any website
- **Domains configured**: Only whitelisted domains can stream videos
- **Blocked domains**: Show a user-friendly "Video Unavailable" message

### Validation Process
1. Video starts playing immediately for the best user experience
2. Domain validation runs asynchronously in the background
3. The validation request is sent to `https://e.trackplay.io/check`
4. If the domain is not whitelisted, video playback is stopped and blocked
5. If validation fails (network issues), videos continue playing as fallback

## Managing Your Whitelist

### Accessing Domain Settings
1. Navigate to your workspace settings
2. Click the **"Domain Whitelist"** tab
3. Add, edit, or remove domains as needed

### Adding Domains
<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Add Domain">
    Click the **"+ Add domain to whitelist"** button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Domain">
    Enter the exact domain name (e.g., `example.com`)
    - Don't include `http://` or `https://`
    - Subdomains must be added separately
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Description">
    Optionally add a description to help identify the domain
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **"Add Domain"** to save the whitelist entry
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Domain Format Examples
| ✅ Correct Format | ❌ Incorrect Format |
|------------------|-------------------|
| `example.com` | `https://example.com` |
| `www.example.com` | `http://www.example.com` |
| `subdomain.example.com` | `example.com/page` |
| `shop.mystore.com` | `*.example.com` |

<Warning>
Each subdomain must be added separately. Adding `example.com` does **not** automatically allow `www.example.com` or `shop.example.com`.
</Warning>

## Managing Existing Domains

### Edit Domain
- Click the **"Edit"** button next to any domain
- Modify the hostname, description, or active status
- Click **"Update Domain"** to save changes

### Deactivate Domain
- Edit the domain and uncheck **"Active"**
- Inactive domains will block video playback
- Useful for temporarily restricting access

### Remove Domain
- Click the **"Remove"** button next to any domain
- Confirm the deletion in the popup
- Domain will be permanently removed from whitelist

## Integration Considerations

### Player Behavior
When a domain is blocked:
- Video starts playing normally for optimal user experience
- Domain validation happens asynchronously in the background
- If domain is not whitelisted, video playback is stopped and shows:

```
Video Unavailable
This video cannot be played from this domain. Contact the video owner for access.
```

The validation component:
- Destroys HLS instance to stop streaming
- Resets video element source
- Shows user-friendly blocked overlay
- Tracks 'domain-blocked' event for analytics

### Error Handling
If domain validation fails due to network issues:
- Videos will play normally (fail-safe approach)
- Error is logged to browser console
- Consider implementing retry logic in your integration

### Development & Testing
During development, you may want to:
1. Add `localhost` to your whitelist
2. Add your staging domain
3. Test blocked domain behavior on unauthorized domains

## Common Use Cases

### E-commerce Store
```
✅ Allowed Domains:
- mystore.com
- www.mystore.com  
- checkout.mystore.com
```

### Marketing Campaign
```
✅ Allowed Domains:
- campaign.example.com
- landing.marketing.com
- partner-site.com
```

### Content Protection
```
❌ Block unauthorized use on:
- Competitor websites
- Spam/malicious sites
- Unauthorized resellers
```

## Troubleshooting

### Videos Not Playing
1. **Check domain whitelist**: Ensure the current domain is added
2. **Verify subdomain**: `www.example.com` ≠ `example.com`
3. **Check domain status**: Ensure domain is marked as "Active"

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Video blocks on `www` subdomain | Add both `example.com` and `www.example.com` |
| Development site blocked | Add `localhost` or your dev domain |
| Staging environment blocked | Add staging domain to whitelist |

### Getting Help
If you encounter issues:
- Check browser console for validation errors
- Verify domain format matches exactly
- Contact support with your workspace code and domain details

<Info>
Domain validation logs are available in your workspace analytics for monitoring and debugging purposes.
