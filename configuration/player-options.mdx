TrackPlay offers extensive customization options configured through your dashboard. Understanding these options helps you build integrations that work with any player configuration.

## Visual & Controls

### Autoplay Settings
Controls how videos start playing automatically.

**Available Options:**
- **Autoplay enabled/disabled**
- **Custom autoplay video** (different preview video)
- **Autoplay time range** (specific start/end times)
- **Pulsating effects** during autoplay
- **Custom autoplay templates** with HTML/CSS

**Impact on Integration:**
- When enabled, videos may start playing immediately
- `play` event may fire automatically on page load
- Continue watching takes precedence over autoplay for returning users

### Thumbnail Images
Custom thumbnail images displayed when autoplay is disabled or video is paused.

**Available Options:**
- **Landscape thumbnail** (for desktop/wide screens)
- **Portrait thumbnail** (for mobile/narrow screens)
- **Orientation-aware display** (shows appropriate thumbnail based on video orientation)
- **Draggable positioning** with visual canvas editor
- **Custom image uploads** to BunnyCDN storage

**Configuration Process:**
1. Navigate to the **Thumbnail** tab in video customization
2. Upload separate images for landscape and portrait orientations
3. Use the visual canvas editor to position thumbnails precisely
4. Deploy changes to make thumbnails live

**Impact on Integration:**
- Thumbnails display when `autoplay` is disabled and video hasn't started
- Automatically adapts to video orientation (landscape/portrait)
- `thumbnail` overlay can be triggered programmatically
- Works seamlessly with continue watching and pause menu features

**Technical Details:**
- Supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP formats (up to 10MB)
- Images are uploaded to workspace-specific CDN folders
- URLs are stored in `thumbnail_options.landscape_image` and `thumbnail_options.portrait_image`
- Positioning data stored in overlay configuration for canvas editor

### Style & Appearance
Customizes the visual appearance of the player.

**Available Options:**
- **Main color** (primary brand color)
- **Background color** (player background)
- **Controls bar style** (default vs. solid)
- **Control visibility** (show/hide individual controls)

**Control Options:**
- Center play button
- Corner play button
- Classic progress bar
- Video time display
- Rewind/forward buttons
- Fullscreen button
- Settings button (speed controls)
- **Play in fullscreen** (auto-fullscreen mode)

**Impact on Integration:**
- Available controls affect which user interactions are possible
- Auto-fullscreen mode triggers `fullscreen` event immediately
- Control visibility affects user experience and event frequency

### Progress Bar
Customizes how video progress is displayed.

**Available Options:**
- **Smart progress** (non-linear progress display)
- **Progress bar colors** and styling
- **Height and background** customization
- **Classic vs. modern** progress bar styles

**Impact on Integration:**
- Progress visualization affects user engagement
- Smart progress may show different completion percentages
- Custom styling doesn't affect `time` event data

## Functional Features

### Continue Watching
Allows users to resume videos from where they left off.

**Configuration Options:**
- **Enable/disable** continue watching
- **Minimum watch time** threshold (how long before it's considered "watched")
- **Custom templates** for continue watching overlay
- **Continue/restart button** styling and behavior

**Impact on Integration:**
- `continue-watching` event fires when overlay is shown
- Minimum watch time determines when feature activates
- Only works for returning users who meet watch time threshold

### Smart Orientation
Automatically detects and responds to video orientation.

**Configuration Options:**
- **Enable/disable** smart orientation
- **Orientation-specific** styling and behavior
- **Automatic layout** adjustments

**Impact on Integration:**
- `portrait` and `landscape` events fire based on video dimensions
- Affects responsive design requirements
- May trigger layout changes automatically

### Captions & Overlays
Manages text overlays and paused state content.

**Configuration Options:**
- **Caption display** and styling
- **Custom paused overlays** with HTML/CSS
- **Overlay positioning** and timing
- **Text styling** and colors

**Impact on Integration:**
- Custom overlays may affect user interactions
- Paused overlays can include interactive elements
- Overlay events may be available depending on configuration

## Advanced Features

### Turbo Mode
Optimizes video loading and playback performance.

**Configuration Options:**
- **Enable/disable** turbo mode
- **Preloading strategies**
- **Bandwidth optimization**

**Impact on Integration:**
- May affect `metadata` event timing
- Can influence video loading speed
- Affects user experience but not event data

### Playback Controls
Fine-tunes video playback behavior.

**Configuration Options:**
- **Default playback speed**
- **Available speed options**
- **Skip intervals** (rewind/forward amounts)
- **Playback shortcuts** and hotkeys

**Impact on Integration:**
- Speed changes affect playback timing
- Skip intervals affect user interaction patterns
- Shortcuts may trigger playback events

## Event-Related Configuration

### Timed Events
Custom events that fire at specific times.

**Configuration Impact:**
- **Event names** are completely custom
- **Trigger timing** can be time-based or percentage-based
- **Call frequency** affects how often events fire
- **Subsequent visits** may have different event names

**Integration Considerations:**
- Event names must match your JavaScript listeners
- Timing precision depends on video playback
- Session-based events require proper handling

### Conversion Pixels
Third-party tracking integration.

**Configuration Impact:**
- **Pixel types** determine event naming convention
- **Trigger conditions** affect when pixel events fire
- **Session limits** control firing frequency
- **Custom pixels** can execute arbitrary JavaScript

**Integration Considerations:**
- Pixel events complement your existing tracking
- Event naming follows predictable patterns
- Session limits prevent pixel spam

### User Event Tracking
Tracks user interactions with the page.

**Configuration Options:**
- **Content engagement tracking** (scroll, hover, click)
- **Targeted elements only** (data-trackplay attributes)
- **Interaction sensitivity** settings

**Impact on Integration:**
- These interactions are tracked automatically
- Not available as player events (they're tracked separately)
- Use `data-trackplay` attributes for targeted tracking

## Configuration Dependencies

Some features interact with each other:

### Autoplay + Continue Watching
- Continue watching **overrides** autoplay for returning users
- Autoplay settings apply to first-time visitors
- Both features can be enabled simultaneously

### Fullscreen + Style
- Fullscreen behavior depends on control visibility
- Auto-fullscreen mode requires fullscreen button to be enabled
- Style settings affect fullscreen appearance

### Timed Events + Pixels
- Both can trigger at the same time points
- Pixels fire independently of timed events
- Session limits apply to both separately

### User Tracking + Targeted Elements
- When targeted elements is enabled, only `data-trackplay` elements are tracked
- General content engagement tracking is disabled
- Affects what interactions are monitored

## Best Practices for Integration

### Handle Configuration Variations
Your integration should work regardless of configuration:

```javascript
// Example: Handle optional features gracefully
document.addEventListener('TrackPlayReady', function (e) {
  let player = e.detail.player;
  
  // Always handle core events
  player.on('play', handlePlay);
  player.on('paused', handlePaused);
  
  // Handle optional events that may not exist
  player.on('continue-watching', handleContinueWatching);
  player.on('fullscreen', handleFullscreen);
  
  // Handle custom events (these are configuration-dependent)
  player.on('show_cta', handleCTA);
  player.on('special_offer', handleOffer);
});
```

### Test Different Scenarios
- Test with different control configurations
- Verify behavior with autoplay enabled/disabled
- Check continue watching with various minimum watch times
- Test fullscreen behavior with different style settings

### Responsive Design
- Handle both portrait and landscape orientations
- Prepare for auto-fullscreen mode
- Design for different control bar styles
- Consider various progress bar configurations
